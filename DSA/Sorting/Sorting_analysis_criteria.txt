1. Time Complexity - O(n^2), O(log n) etc
2. Space Complexity - inplace ,or using extra space etc
3. Stability - stable sort, unstable sort
4. Internal Sorting - All the data is loaded into memory (main memory)
   External Sorting - All the data is not loaded into memory (main memory)
5. Adaptive - Already sorted data takes less time
6. Recursive/Non Recursive Sorting Algorithm - recursive if it uses recursion
