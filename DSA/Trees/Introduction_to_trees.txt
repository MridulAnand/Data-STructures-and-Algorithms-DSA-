Tree is Non Linear Data Structure
Ideal for representing hierarchical data structure 

Most Common Terminology:-

1. Root:- Top most node
2. Parent:- Node which connects to the child
3. Child:- Node which is connected by another node is child
4. Leaf/External node:- Nodes with no children
5. Internal node:- Node with at least one child
6. Depth:- No. of edges from root to the node
7. Height:- No. of edges from node to deepest leaf
8. Siblings:- Nodes belonging to the same parents
9. Ancestors/Descendants:-

Binary Tree:-

1. Tree is made up of nodes and edges
2. n nodes then n-1 edges
3. Degree for node is number of direct children
4. Degree of tree is the highest degree of a node among all the nodes present in the tree
5. Binary tree = tree of degree 2 (Nodes can have 0, 1 or 2 children)

Types of Binary Trees:-

1. Full or Strict Binary tree
   All nodes have either 0 or 2 children

2. Perfect Binary tree
   Internal nodes have 2 children and also all leaf nodes are on same level

3. Complete Binary tree
   All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level also last level must have its keys as left has possible

4. Degenerate tree
   Every parent node has exactly one child

5. Skewed Binary tree
   Left skewed:- All child nodes are in left side
   Right skewed:- All child nodes are in right side

Representation of Binary Tree:- 

1. Array representation:-  Array{6,11,2,7,1,11,9,null,10}
2. Linked representation:- (Not called LinkedList representation because LinkedList is linear but tree is non linear)
         [.|2|.]
         /     \
   [.|3|.]      [.|4|.]
   /     \      /     \
[.|5|.][.|1|.] [.|2|.] [.|6|.] 
   /      \       /       \
  Null    Null   Null     Null

Traversal in a Binary Tree:- 

1. Pre Order Traversal:- Root -> Left subtree -> Right subtree
2. Post Order Traversal:- Left subtree -> Right subtree -> Root
3. In Order Traversal:- Left subtree -> Root -> Right subtree

(Trick to remember, left and right will be always there on their corresponding locations but root will change its location in pre root will be first, in post root will be last and for in order root will be on middle)

examples:- Tree
         7
       /   \
      2     3
     /       \
    1         4
pre order of this:- 7 2 1 3 4
post order of this:- 1 2 4 3 7
in order of this:- 1 2 7 3 4

Binary Search Tree (BST):- 

1. BST is a type of Binary Tree
2. All nodes of the left subtree are lesser than root or parent node
3. All nodes of the right subtree are greater than root or parent node
4. Left and right subtrees are also BST
5. There are no duplicate nodes
6. Inorder traversal of BST is acsending sorted array

Example of BST:- 
            9
           / \
          4   11
         / \    \
        2   7    15
           / \   /
          5   8 14
Inorder traversal:- 2 4 5 7 8 9 11 14 15 (Example of property 6) 

AVL Tree:
-
Why do we need AVL Tree?

1. Almost all operations in binary search tree are of order O(h) where his the height of the tree
2. If we don't plan our tree properly, this height can get as high as n where n is the number of nodes in a BST (skewed tree)
3. To guarantee an upper bound of O(log n) for all these operations, we use balanced trees

What is an AVL Tree?

1. Height balanced binary search trees
2. Height difference between heights of left and right subtree for every node is less than or equal to 1
3. Balanced factor = Height of right subtree-Height of left subtree
4. Can be -1, 0 or 1 for a node to be balanced in a binary search tree
5. Can -1, 0 or 1 for all nodes of an AVL tree

Rotations in AVL Tree:-

1. LL rotation
2. RR rotation
3. LR rotation
4. RL rotation
(Where R = Right and L = Left)
